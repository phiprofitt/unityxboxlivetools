# Unity Xbox Live Tools
This is a repo that will contain tools for using Xbox Live in Unity with the Universal Windows Platform

AddXboxLiveConfig.cs can be added to a UWP Unity project, and will at build time create an XboxServices.config file automatically while also adding the file as a piece of content to your final VS solution.
